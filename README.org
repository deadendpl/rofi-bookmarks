Writing a shell script for handling a tsv file was too hard, so I wrote it in Common Lisp.
* Usage
#+begin_example
rofi-bookmarks path-to-tsv-file
#+end_example
* TSV file structure
#+begin_example
Name of the Website	https://url-of-the-website
#+end_example
* Installation
Install [[https://www.sbcl.org/][SBCL]], and in the repo's root run
#+begin_example
make
#+end_example
It will make =rofi-bookmarks= executable. Put it anywhere you like.
